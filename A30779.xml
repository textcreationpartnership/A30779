            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A Propoſal Humbly offered for the Farming of Liberty of Conſcience</head>
            <p>SInce nothing can be dearer unto poor Chriſtians than Liberty, or the free exerciſe of their Judgements and Conſcience, which hath kindled that fire in the bowels of the three King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, which all the precious blood that hath been ſhed, during thoſe late Troubles, hath not been able totally to extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh: And ſince many of us, whoſe names are affixed, were ſo profitable inſtrumental in thoſe late Combuſtions, as appears all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long in our Sermons before the Honourable Houſe of Parliament, in the Years 1642. 43.44.45.46. in exciting the good people of this Nation, to ſeek and maintain their Chriſtian Liberty, againſt all Prelaticall and Antichriſtian Impoſition whatſoever. And con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering that the Little Finger of Apoſtaſie from our firſt Love, would be a greater burden upon our tender Conſciences than the Loyns of Epiſcopacy. We being more bound in Honour than Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, cannot totally deſiſt; neither need any man fear, or ſo much as ſuſpect, leſt any inconvenience or alteration ſhould happen in Religion, by the great diverſity of Opinions, Tongues, and Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages, tolerated amongſt us, unleſs in the great <hi>Babel</hi> of Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy, that may poſſibly be pulled down and deſtroyed by this our notable Confution; For if the Goſpel was wonderfully difininated, and ſpread abroad by every mans ſpeaking in his own Language, and the very Enemies thereof aſtoniſhed, and miraculouſly wrought in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a belief of it: how is it likely to be now obſtructed in the free exerciſe of our Spiritual Gifts, with theſe our cloven and devided Tongues. And ſince many worthy (Perſons) from whom we might little expect it, but far leſs deſerve it, out of their goodneſs and clemency, are pleaſed to encline to ſome Liberty, did not ſome Perſons, Aliens and Strangers to the Common-wealth of <hi>Iſrael.</hi>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:52874:3"/>take up a reproach againſt us, as Perſons reprobated into a unpoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of ſubmiſſion to Principles of Concord, Peace, and Order, in Church or State, never being able hitherto to come to any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtency amongſt our ſelves; The Ark of God having for twenty years together been expoſed to by-wayes, ſtreets, and worſe places, for want of an agreement amongſt our own Brethren where to reſt it, or how to entertain it. If this be our Caſe, and could we be ſure of ſo much favour as <hi>Saul</hi> once deſired of <hi>Samuel,</hi> that the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops would but honour us before the people, We would in a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Chriſtian way lay our hands upon our hearts, and acknowledge the hand of God, and the juſtice thereof, in turning us out of his Vineyard, as wicked and unprofitable Servants, and to ſuffer the iniquity of our heels to overtake us; crying out with Reverend Mr. <hi>Calamy, The Ark of God is juſtly departed from us;</hi> but being not yet thus aſſured, do hope the people will yet believe theſe to be on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Bears skins lapt about us by Epiſcopal hands: And therefore to the end that a Conſiſtency, and Oneneſs of Judgement of the whole ſeperating Brethren, and their moderation may be known unto all men, and that the World may know that there is a Spirit of Rule and Government reſting in us;</p>
